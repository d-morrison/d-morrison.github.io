Welcome to our first UCLA Biostatistics Computing Club meeting! The first topic will be blogdown \u0026amp; You: Creating a Personal Website Using R so that students can have a space to showcase their work for future employers.\nPlease make sure that you have git installed and RStudio configured to use git. If you need help with this, see Jenny Bryan's tutorial for Mac users and if you need additional trouble-shooting, feel free to email Emilie. Unfortunately I do not use Windows but I found this tutorial that may help. The blogdown tutorial will follow Alison Hill's very closely so feel free to read through it beforehand.\nJoin the meeting with this Zoom link: https://ucla.zoom.us/j/231979834.\n","date":1586458800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586458800,"objectID":"33870fcd483530c4aba383b75e27290f","permalink":"/talk/2020-bsa-blogdown/2020-bsa-blogdown/","publishdate":"2019-03-05T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2020-bsa-blogdown/2020-bsa-blogdown/","section":"talk","summary":"An introduction to blogdown","tags":["blogdown","BSA","R"],"title":"blogdown \u0026 You","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Emilie Campos"],"categories":["talks"],"content":"","date":1585150200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585150200,"objectID":"9c86c563323d33413027c3a0703ca0c5","permalink":"/talk/2020-enar-perpred/2020-enar-perpred/","publishdate":"2019-03-24T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2020-enar-perpred/2020-enar-perpred/","section":"talk","summary":"An introduction to Principle ERP Reduction (pERP-RED) and pERP-space analysis","tags":["pERPred","EEG","Functional Data Analysis","PCA","ICA"],"title":"Principle ERP Reduction (pERP-RED)","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Emilie Campos"],"categories":["talks"],"content":"","date":1583877600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583877600,"objectID":"43ec45adf86cd30ce68638add3db91b3","permalink":"/talk/2020-285-final/2020_285-final/","publishdate":"2019-03-05T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2020-285-final/2020_285-final/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Hybrid Principal Components Analysis","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Emilie Campos"],"categories":[],"content":" As this is my first post, this more of a tutorial for myself than it is for anyone else.\n","date":1583366400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583366400,"objectID":"7d031ca13958aabac4e85f04078d67d0","permalink":"/post/functional-data-analysis/","publishdate":"2020-03-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/functional-data-analysis/","section":"post","summary":"An introduction to functional data analysis","tags":["Functional Data Analysis","R"],"title":"Functional Data Analysis","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"6087c0ef875554f4409ac52928d79279","permalink":"/projects/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/","section":"","summary":"Projects I have worked on","tags":null,"title":"Projects","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"65de3680a280f6bf29dc34fe1adad5a6","permalink":"/talks/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/","section":"","summary":"Upcoming and recent talks / workshops","tags":null,"title":"Talks \u0026 Workshops","type":"widget_page"}]
