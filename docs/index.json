A scenario is considered in which an interval-censored covariate of interest is defined as a function of other variables. Instead of directly modeling the distribution of the interval-censored covariate of interest, the distributions of the variables which determine that covariate are modeled, and the distribution of the covariate of interest is inferred indirectly. This approach leads to an estimation procedure using the EM algorithm. The performance of this approach is compared with two alternative approaches, one in which the censoring interval midpoints are used as estimates of the censored covariate values, and another in which the censored values are multiply imputed using uniform distributions over the censoring intervals. A simulation framework is constructed to assess these methods’ accuracies across a range of scenarios. The proposed approach is found to have less bias than midpoint analysis and uniform imputation, at the cost of small increases in standard error.","tags":["Cross-Sectional Incidence Estimation","R"],"title":"Regression with interval-censored covariates: Application to cross-sectional incidence estimation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Douglas Ezra Morrison","Roch Nianogo","Vladimir Manuel","Onyebuchi Arah","Nathaniel Anderson","Tony Kuo","Moira Inkelas"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1610323200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610323200,"objectID":"9780a28cdbc02fd881931608d5a132d6","permalink":"https://d-morrison.github.io/publication/lausd2021/","publishdate":"2019-06-22T14:27:48-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/lausd2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Objective To support safer in-person K-6 instruction during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic by providing public health authorities and school districts with a practical model of transmission dynamics and mitigation strategies. \n\n Methods We developed an agent-based model of infection dynamics and preventive mitigation strategies such as distancing, health behaviors, surveillance and symptomatic testing, daily symptom and exposure screening, quarantine policies, and vaccination.

Leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) to monitor outpatient clinical encounters may lead to the identification of emerging outbreaks. \n\n Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate whether excess visits where the word “cough” was present in the EHR reason for visit, and hospitalizations with acute respiratory failure were more frequent from December 2019 to February 2020 compared with the preceding 5 years. \n\n Methods: A retrospective observational cohort was identified from a large US health system with 3 hospitals, over 180 clinics, and 2.5 million patient encounters annually. Data from patient encounters from July 1, 2014, to February 29, 2020, were included. Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) time-series models were used to evaluate if the observed winter 2019/2020 rates were higher than the forecast 95% prediction intervals. The estimated excess number of visits and hospitalizations in winter 2019/2020 were calculated compared to previous seasons. \n\n Results: The percentage of patients presenting with an EHR reason for visit containing the word “cough” to clinics exceeded the 95% prediction interval the week of December 22, 2019, and was consistently above the 95% prediction interval all 10 weeks through the end of February 2020. Similar trends were noted for emergency department visits and hospitalizations starting December 22, 2019, where observed data exceeded the 95% prediction interval in 6 and 7 of the 10 weeks, respectively. The estimated excess over the 3-month 2019/2020 winter season, obtained by either subtracting the maximum or subtracting the average of the five previous seasons from the current season, was 1.6 or 2.0 excess visits for cough per 1000 outpatient visits, 11.0 or 19.2 excess visits for cough per 1000 emergency department visits, and 21.4 or 39.1 excess visits per 1000 hospitalizations with acute respiratory failure, respectively. The total numbers of excess cases above the 95% predicted forecast interval were 168 cases in the outpatient clinics, 56 cases for the emergency department, and 18 hospitalized with acute respiratory failure. \n\n Conclusions: A significantly higher number of patients with respiratory complaints and diseases starting in late December 2019 and continuing through February 2020 suggests community spread of SARS-CoV-2 prior to established clinical awareness and testing capabilities. This provides a case example of how health system analytics combined with EHR data can provide powerful and agile tools for identifying when future trends in patient populations are outside of the expected ranges.","tags":["COVID-19","electronic health records","time-series analysis","forecasting"],"title":"Excess Patient Visits for Cough and Pulmonary Disease at a Large US Health System in the Months Prior to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Time-Series Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vivek Shetty","Douglas Morrison","Thomas Belin","Timothy Hnat","Santosh Kumar"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1592956800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592956800,"objectID":"07b0518ab3c265daa4df491d17a1e3a3","permalink":"https://d-morrison.github.io/publication/shetty2020/","publishdate":"2019-06-22T14:27:48-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/shetty2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Dental disease (including dental caries and periodontal disease) is largely preventable and closely linked to inadequate oral health behaviors. Digital health technologies have great potential for unobtrusively monitoring brushing behaviors in home settings and promoting optimal oral self-care routines at scale. \n\n Objective: The aim of this study is to leverage the ubiquity of electronic toothbrushes and smartphones with the development of a Remote Oral Behaviors Assessment System (ROBAS) and evaluate its feasibility for passively tracking brushing behaviors in real-world settings. \n\n Methods: We developed ROBAS by linking inertial sensors contained within consumer electronic toothbrushes to a scalable software platform comprised of a smartphone app linked to a cloud platform. First, the criterion validity of ROBAS for accurately capturing brushing details was established in a laboratory setting. Next, real-world performance and usability were evaluated in a stratified community sample of 32 participants who used ROBAS daily for 1 month and maintained a diary of their brushing episodes. Semistructured interviews at baseline and exit captured the user experience. We used regression models and Bland-Altman analyses to assess the criterion validity, functionality, accuracy, and consistency of ROBAS. \n\n Results: Using a stopwatch as the criterion reference, ROBAS showed a mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of 1.8%, an estimated bias of 0.64 seconds that was not statistically distinguishable from zero (95% CI –0.93 to 2.22 seconds, SE 0.79), and a connection failure rate of 6.7% (95% CI 0.8%-22.1%, SE 4.6%). In real-world testing, ROBAS showed close agreement with the daily diary recordings of brushing episodes; estimated average discrepancies between the diary and ROBAS were 0.13 sessions per day (95% CI 0.01-0.26, SE 0.06), 8.0 seconds per brushing session (95% CI 1.4-14.7, SE 3.3), and 30 seconds of brushing per day (95% CI 9.3-50.1, SE 10.0). Retrospective self-reports produced substantially higher estimates of brushing frequency and duration compared to ROBAS measurements. Participants reported ROBAS was easy to use and expressed an interest in receiving ROBAS-delivered feedback on their brushing behaviors. Most participants were bothered by the use of an additional study phone, and some reported connectivity-related issues. \n\n Conclusions: ROBAS has a high criterion validity for measuring oral health behaviors. It can accurately and reliably monitor brushing patterns in home settings for extended periods. Unobtrusive data collection through ROBAS sets the stage for automated coaching and optimization of oral self-care practices at the individual and population level.","tags":["health behaviors","oral self-care","digital tools","remote monitoring","passive measurement","mobile health"],"title":"A Scalable System for Passively Monitoring Oral Health Behaviors Using Electronic Toothbrushes in the Home Setting: Development and Feasibility Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Douglas Ezra Morrison","Oliver Laeyendecker","Ron Brookmeyer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1567123200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567123200,"objectID":"11c2fa6e591469fd182095e732d96d0e","permalink":"https://d-morrison.github.io/publication/art/","publishdate":"2019-06-22T14:27:48-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/art/","section":"publication","summary":"The cross-sectional approach to HIV incidence estimation overcomes some of the challenges with longitudinal cohort studies and has been successfully applied in many settings around the world. However, the cross-sectional approach does rely on an initial training data set to develop and calibrate the statistical methods to be used in cross-sectional surveys. The problem addressed in this paper is that the initial training data set may, over time, not reflect the current target population of interest because of evolution of the epidemic. For example, the mismatch between the target population and the initial data set could occur because of increasing use of anti-retroviral therapy among HIV-infected persons throughout the world. We developed methods to adjust the initial training data set with the goal that the adjusted data sets better reflect the target population. These adjustment procedures could help avoid the time and expense of collecting a completely new training data set from the current target population. We report the results of a simulation study to evaluate the procedures. We applied the methods to a dataset of HIV subtype B infection. The adjustment procedures could be applicable in situations other than cross-sectional incidence estimation where complex statistical analyses are to be conducted using an initial data set but those results may not be directly transportable to a new target population of interest. The approach we have proposed could offer a practical and cost-effective way to apply cross-sectional incidence methods to new target populations as the epidemic evolves.","tags":["Cross-Sectional Incidence Estimation","R"],"title":"Cross‐sectional HIV incidence estimation in an evolving epidemic","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"6087c0ef875554f4409ac52928d79279","permalink":"https://d-morrison.github.io/projects/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/","section":"","summary":"Projects I have worked on","tags":null,"title":"Projects","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"23d1e75f872528fc12f5f2b142375ff7","permalink":"https://d-morrison.github.io/publications/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/","section":"","summary":"Upcoming and recent publications","tags":null,"title":"Publications","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"65de3680a280f6bf29dc34fe1adad5a6","permalink":"https://d-morrison.github.io/talks/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/","section":"","summary":"Upcoming and recent talks / workshops","tags":null,"title":"Talks \u0026 Workshops","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["Douglas Ezra Morrison","Oliver Laeyendecker","Jacob Konikoff","Ron Brookmeyer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1532995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1532995200,"objectID":"a37624c072a312085cd6e7bf05ac3118","permalink":"https://d-morrison.github.io/publication/missingdata/","publishdate":"2018-07-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/missingdata/","section":"publication","summary":"Considerable progress has been made in the development of approaches for HIV incidence estimation based on a cross-sectional survey for biomarkers of recent infection. Multiple biomarkers when used in combination can increase the precision of cross-sectional HIV incidence estimates. Multi-assay algorithms (MAAs) for cross-sectional HIV incidence estimation are hierarchical stepwise algorithms for testing the biological samples with multiple biomarkers. The objective of this paper is to consider some of the statistical challenges for addressing the problem of missing biomarkers in such testing algorithms. We consider several methods for handling missing biomarkers for (1) estimating the mean window period, and (2) estimating HIV incidence from a cross sectional survey once the mean window period has been determined. We develop a conditional estimation approach for addressing the missing data challenges and compare that method with two naïve approaches. Using MAAs developed for HIV subtype B, we evaluate the methods by simulation. We show that the two naïve estimation methods lead to biased results in most of the missing data scenarios considered. The proposed conditional approach protects against bias in all of the scenarios.","tags":["Cross-Sectional Incidence Estimation","R"],"title":"Cross-Sectional HIV Incidence Estimation with Missing Biomarkers","type":"publication"}]
