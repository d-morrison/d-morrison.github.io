I am a graduating doctoral student at UCLA, where I have been advised by [Ron Brookmeyer](https://ph.ucla.edu/faculty/brookmeyer), [Tom Belin](https://ph.ucla.edu/faculty/belin), [Sudipto Banerjee](https://ph.ucla.edu/faculty/banerjee), and [Onyebuchi Arah](https://ph.ucla.edu/faculty/arah).

I have worked on a variety of applied and theoretical statistical challenges, including problems in causal inference, data fusion, and infectious disease surveillance. 

For the past year, I have served as the Vice President of Financial Affairs for the [UCLA Biostatistics Student Association](https://ucla-bsa.github.io).
