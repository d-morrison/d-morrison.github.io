abstract = "Event-related potentials (ERP) waveforms are the summation of many overlapping signals. Changes in the peak or mean amplitude of a waveform over a given time period, therefore, cannot reliably be attributed to a particular ERP component of *ex ante* interest, as is the standard approach to ERP analysis. Though this problem is widely recognized, it is not well addressed in practice. Our approach begins by presuming that any observed ERP waveform --- at any electrode, for any trial type, and for any participant --- is approximately a weighted combination of signals from an underlying set of what we refer to as *principle ERPs*, or pERPs. We propose an accessible approach to analyzing complete ERP waveforms in terms of their underlying pERPs. Software for conducting these analyses is provided in the `pERPred` package for `R`."
