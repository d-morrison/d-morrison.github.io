Hi! Welcome to our first UCLA Biostatistics Computing Club meeting! The first topic will be *blogdown & You: Creating a Personal Website Using R* so that students can have a space to showcase their work for future employers.

Please make sure that you have git installed and RStudio configured to use git. If you need help with this, see Jenny Bryan's [tutorial](https://jennybc.github.io/2014-05-12-ubc/ubc-r/session03_git.html) for Mac users and if you need additional trouble-shooting, feel free to email [Emilie](mailto:ejcampos@ucla.edu). Unfortunately I do not use Windows but I found this [tutorial](http://www.geo.uzh.ch/microsite/reproducible_research/post/rr-rstudio-git/) that may help. The blogdown tutorial will follow [Alison Hill's](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/) very closely so feel free to read through it beforehand.

Join the meeting with this Zoom link: [https://ucla.zoom.us/j/231979834](https://ucla.zoom.us/j/231979834).
